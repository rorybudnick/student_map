To Do
1. Location info needs to pop up on click
2. Geolocation a.k.a. a marker where you are located(this is a quick one)
3. Student info: not sure where to put this.  Seems like a lot to see on click if there end up being many students.  Maybe a link from the location info that eventually comes up on click.
4. Header/Title with School on Wheels logo
5. Log in system-- even if it's 1 shared username/password, just as a wall
6. A better URL-- I'll look into cheap options
7. Readme
8. TODO: Use a different markup language if you do not plan to run
<tt>rake doc:app</tt>.
9. Admin ability to create students/locations
10. Ability to import students/locations
