TODO
6. Location info needs to pop up on click
3. Setting Lat Long after location creation, prob move to model-- figure out rake task too
1. TODO: Use a different markup language if you do not plan to run
<tt>rake doc:app</tt>.
2. Readme
4. Geolocation
5. Student Info


1) Geolocation a.k.a. a marker where you are located(this is a quick one)
2) More information about the site when you click on it-- right now you can only get the name when you hover.  I think student count might make sense here.
3) Student info: not sure where to put this.  Seems like a lot to see on click if there end up being many students.  Maybe a link from the location info that eventually comes up on click.
4) Header/Title with School on Wheels logo
5) Potentially a log in system-- even if it's 1 shared username/password, just as a wall
6) A better URL-- I'll look into cheap options
